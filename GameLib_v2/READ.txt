Version number is NOT 2, technically...
But, it will be a significant leap when this becomes official

The library is being re-designed to use Stampit for all its OOP
Benefits are:
	Exploit JS loose typed nature and remove the ridged class construct
	Not having to write some annoying/ugly/repetitive code to do OOP
	Actually tolerable to continue writing JS directly

It also is being converted into self-contained modules*
Benefits are:
	No more global scope pollution
	Easier to do feature checks

*Before it's asked or Suggested, NOT NODE/NPM modules...
Absolutely no way is that happening, nor will it ever happen.

One other tidbit : some broken features will be fixed
	fixed:
		progress meters! (they did work when I intitally coded them, I broke them during a re-factor)
