re-structure
impelment new and useful features derivived from other projects
add debugging class
add loading screen
add versions
onload event handlers for assets (in case same assets requested by multiple objects)
onerror event handlers for assets (crash game, tell me why)
queing assets, not just loading them immediately
add system kill screen (game halts entirely and gives option for a dump, which is debugger's logs)
run-time/on-demand generated/prepared assets (requires soome major re-writes to asset manager)
start work on binary asset type
address sprite class
standardize some of the indev features
fix major bugs with UI system
upgrade UI system

add namespace
sprite upgrade idea...
-effectively, for every sprite asset, only one sprite object is created
-unsure of performance benefits, if any...
