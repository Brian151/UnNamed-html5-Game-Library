					<h4>
						About Quality Cat Game Library
					</h4>
					<p>
						Quality Cat Game Library (name pending) is a small, lightweight open-source JavaScript library for developing
						games with the HTML5 canvas element. At this time, MANY of its features are still work-in-progress,
						and some are even unstable.
					</p>
					<h4>Why the name?</h4>
					<p>
						Branding, pretty much.
					</p>
					<h4>ANOTHER Library?!</h4>
					<p>
						Yes, another library. I didn't want to deal with the steep learning curve and massive overhead
						of using most of the other libraries out there. I also didn't feel like paying money for access to
						most of the engines out there, like GameMaker's HTML5 module and the full version of Construct2. I
						also found it pretty ironic/annoying that the supposed "open web" is being milked by
						the various groups and individuals developing paid, proprietary engines and IDES.
					</p>
					<h4>What can it do?</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Make the HTML Canvas element a LOT easier to use</li>
						<li>Create custom user interfaces (WIP, BUGGY!)</li>
						<li>Manage assets and asset loading(WIP)</li>
						<li>Manage keyboard and mouse input</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>What can't do?</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Replace highly advanced IDES/Libraries/Engines like Flash,Unity,CreateJS,Jquery</li>
						<li>playing audio, HTML5 handles this poorly, in general. (planned?)</li>
						<li>throw an entire game/engine/'app' together in almost no time at all</li>
						<li>achieve real-time performance (cuz, JavaScript!)</li>
					</ol>
