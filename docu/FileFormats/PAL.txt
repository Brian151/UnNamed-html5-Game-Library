PAL file, as according to Worms Knowledge Base,
with extra notes and speculation

"RIFF" file sig
uint32 [lit] fileLen
	"PAL " form sig
	{
	"data" data sig
	uint32 [lit] datLen
	uint16 [lit] datVer 0x0300
	uint16 [lit] colCount
	<colCount> entries 
		{
		byte red
		byte green
		byte blue
		byte flags
		}
	}
	{
	"offl"
	len
	}
	{
	"tran" //based on name, this is probably transparency
	len
	/*
		uint16 entries
		<entries> bytes transparency
	*/
	}
	{
	"unde"
	len
	}

size for chunk heads:	
head data = 12 bytes
section headers = 32 bytes
!can remove 24 bytes of the extra data sections
section headers = 8 bytes
total (heads) = 20 bytes

size for data:
datVer = 2 bytes
count = 2 bytes
(count * 4) = ? bytes for entries

size for offl:
!if not used : 0

size for trans:
!if not used : 0
!if used:
2 bytes count
(count bytes) = ? bytes for entries

size for unde
!if not used : 0

for modern purposes, the files can be done as
"RIFF" <len> "PAL "
"data" {...}
"tran" {...}

that brings head count to 28 bytes
offl and unde are forgotten...
