						These two classes and single HTML are pre-fabricated to streamline the 
						creation of a basic game.

					<h4>
						MainApp
					</h4>
					<p>
						This class is responsible for loading and launching the game. Code containing
						the basic loading and startup functions for a game would be put here. 
						(as to be expected from the Main class) In some cases, this may also control 
						some of the logic of your game while it's running. This pre-configured 'Main' class 
						creates a new MyGame, and sets it to run at 30 FPS, give or take, since JS is actually 
						pretty unreliable for timing consistency. It then creates an interval at the approximate 
						timing for the game's FPS, which is effectively the main game loop.
					</p>
					<h4>
						MyGame
					</h4>
					<p>
						This class extends core.Game. It is pre-configured to bind to a canvas with the id 
						'screen' and creates a GraphicsHandler, InputManager ,and an AssetManager with the
						IDs 'renderer' , 'controller', and 'assets' , respectively.
					</p>
					<h4>
						default.html
					</h4>
					<p>
						A basic HTML with a canvas using the ID 'screen' , and pre-configured to use the template
						classes.
