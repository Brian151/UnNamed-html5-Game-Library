add color palettes [x]
-test with CAC sprites[x]
DOCUMENTATION!!! []
re-structure packages [x]
move color palette code to ImageUtils []
tweak and implement BitmapGenerator in ImageUtils []

wip:
graphics handler usefulness - adding native context 2D draw API calls []
vector engine []
just in general, move/add certain graphics effects to ImageUtils and ColorUtils []
debug class []
add loaderbars to UI stuff []
work more on UIManager object []
make UI buttons more customiz-able []
UI templates? []
skin varients? []

phase-out anonymous checkNull function
+replace with DataTypes, checkNull the becomes a method of that class
+implement better type checking, current leaves a lot to be desired (or rather, JS does...)
 
/*temp*/

impelment new and useful features derivived from other projects
add loading screen
onload event handlers for assets (in case same assets requested by multiple objects)
onerror event handlers for assets (crash game, tell me why)
queing assets, not just loading them immediately
add system kill screen (game halts entirely and gives option for a dump, which is debugger's logs)
run-time/on-demand generated/prepared assets (requires soome major re-writes to asset manager)
start work on binary asset type
address sprite class
standardize some of the indev features
fix major bugs with UI system
upgrade UI system
add namespace
sprite upgrade idea...
-effectively, for every sprite asset, only one sprite object is created
-unsure of performance benefits, if any...
graphics handler rendering to layers

possibly canned:
add phoria to game lib

 //snips
possible JS enumerator:
function Enum(ids) {
this.enums = 0;
for (var i=0; i < ids.length; i++) {
this[ids[i]] = this.emums;
this.enums++;
}
}
